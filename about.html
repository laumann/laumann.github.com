	<p>I am a full-time Master's student at DIKU (Computer Science at Copenhagen University) , with a Bs.C. in Computer Science from Århus University.</p>
	<p>I started programming at the age of 21 upon entering the University in Århus, which is comparatively late when looking at the average initiation age for students of Computer Science</p>
	<p>My interests in Computer Science are rather broad, but one of my chief interests is <em>programming languages</em>. The study and implementation of programming languages is extremely interesting. I have used and studied languages such as Go, Haskell, SML, Scheme, LISP, <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>, Ruby, Python, C, C++, Java, Erlang, Prolog, Scala, JavaScript and Bash. Among the ones I use regularly are Go, <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>, Bash and C. Professionally I use Java (not necessarily <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/java">because I want to</a>).</p>
	<p>I am a strong supporter of the Free Software movement and <a href="http://fsf.org">FSF</a>, and believe the Open Source way of developing software is the path of the future.</p>
	<p>For software I use vim, Zsh, <a href="http://git-scm.org">git</a> and I have been working on a todo list keeper. I follow the development of some software projects, notably <a href="http://kernel.org">Linux</a>, git and <a href="http://github.com/jonas/tig">tig</a>. I have also made a small contribution to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, the static site generator (in Ruby).</p>
	<p>Another interest is <em>social media</em>. Not as user, but as a critic. I believe there is so much unnecessary noise out there that everybody would benefit more from not being around it so much. There is also a question of people not knowing they are a resource for the media they are using, since most believe the media to be a resource for them to use. One of my favorite discussions topics is how much certain social media sites have managed to shift the terms of privacy (but I'll leave this topic for another time). </p>
