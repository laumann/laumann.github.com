<div id="blogroll">
  <h1>Blog</h1>

  <p>This section of the site is dedicated to all things I find interesting, including (but not limited to) computing, computer science, programming languages, I try to categorise posts, but have not been very strict with it.</p>

  <p>This page only shows the last ten posts. For a comprehensive list, please see the <a href="archive.html">archive</a>.</p>

	{% for post in site.posts limit:10 %}
	<article class="uk-article">
		<h2 class="post-title"><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
		<p class="post-meta">Posted on <span class="date">{{ post.date | date_to_string}}</span></p>
		{{ post.content }}
	</article>
	{% endfor %}
