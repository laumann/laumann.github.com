The contents of the +_posts+ directory are copyright (C) Thomas Jespersen 2011.

The favicon was created using http://favicon.cc, and I wanted to release it there under an open license, but unfortunately you have to register an account to do that (which seems silly). Furthermore the license used is Creative Commons (CC), but it is not specified which CC license; if this information appears _after_ registration, I'm oblivious to it. I don't know the terms of usage, when a user created image has _not_ been released under the CC license.

I intend to release the rest under the GNU GPL (or GFDL), once I have figured how it works -- until then, nothing doing.
