<p>I&#8217;ve been an avid user of Youtube, but recently I seemed to be logged in somehow whenever I watched any videos on the site. I then noticed I was logged in via my Gmail account, and Google having recently bought aforementioned video provider, I figured &#8220;Aha, they&#8217;ve linked the two!&#8221;.</p>
<p>And, veritably, yes! But why, I ask? I never had a Youtube account, never wanted it and never want it. All the pish-posh (but quite important) privacy argumentation aside, how does one go about staying logged in to Gmail, but not logged in to Youtube? A quick search provides many answers, but none of them the right one:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=07ca4b7fb0a89d1a&amp;hl=en">How do I unlink Youtube from my Gmail account</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Web%20Search/thread?tid=40d7aac9e43c603e&amp;hl=en">unlink youtube from google account</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?gcx=c&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=unlink+google+account+from+youtube">The search</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, you can&#8217;t! The phrasing of some of the answers seems to be: this is fundamental &#8220;functionality&#8221; of the Google account and therefore you cannot disable this. Especially the best rated answer <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=07ca4b7fb0a89d1a&amp;hl=en">here</a> seems to support this view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is what you get when you go to YouTube <span class="caps">WHILE</span> logged into your Google account [&#8230;]</p>
<p>Because it isn&#8217;t &#8220;linked&#8221; to YouTube but is merely enabled to <span class="caps">USE</span> YouTube [&#8230;] you have, by using it at YouTube, given your Google account YouTube functionality.</p>
<p>You cannot &#8220;remove&#8221; its ability to use YouTube anymore than you can stop your GMail email address from functioning as a means to receiving mail.  If you don&#8217;t want it to be functional on YouTube then don&#8217;t use YouTube while logged into it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a load of h*gw*sh. Google account with Youtube functionality? I don&#8217;t mind, I just don&#8217;t want to use it either <del>-</del> as much as I don&#8217;t want to use other services, I would like the option of <em>not</em> being automatically logged in to Youtube <em>in any way</em> just because my email account is open.</p>
<p>I have read that it&#8217;s possible to have a Google account without Gmail. If Gmail ranks on the same level of service as Youtube, and both can be accessed through a Google account, how can it be that Youtube cannot be disabled, but Gmail can? It doesn&#8217;t make much sense. But in conclusion, to watch videos anonymously, log out!</p>
