  <p>I read a lot. I especially read a lot on the Internet and I
    constantly have multiple tabs open (I <i>never</i>
    want to close an open page &mdash; what if it
    disappears?). Before tabbed browsing I always had
    twenty-seven IE windows open. This was before I
    discovered the joys of free software. Things are
    different now.</p>

  <p>I've been using different services to keep track of web sites I
    liked (like foxmarks (now xmarks)), but that's not what I needed. I
    need more of an archive that plasters together different sources I
    read in conjunction with one another. Therefore this site. I don't
    mean to share &mdash; enough of that is being done already.</p>

  <p>Some credit for the idea should go to my old employer (when I
    worked as a student programmer). I noticed he kept his own start page
    for his browser (I assume an <code>index.html</code> or something
    equally simple), which simply kept all his favourite links. This is
    close, but not quite there. </p>

  <p>For now, this is it. A singly linked list (in chronological order)
    of a bunch of things I (should) read..</p>
