		<p>I read a lot. I especially read a lot on the Internet and I
		constantly have multiple tabs open (I <i>never</i> want to close an open page &mdash; what if it disappears?). Before tabbed browsing I always had twenty-seven IE windows open. This was before I discovered the joys of free software. Things are different now.</p>

<p>I've been using different services to keep track of web sites I liked (like foxmarks (now xmarks)), but that's not what I needed. I need more of an archive that plasters together different sources I read in conjunction with one another. Therefore this site. I don't mean to share &mdash; enough of that is being done already.</p>

<p>Some credit for the idea should go to my old employer (when I worked as a student programmer). I noticed he kept his own start page for his browser (I assume an <code>index.html</code> or something equally simple), which simply kept all his favourite links. This is close, but not quite there. </p>

<p>For now, this is it. A singly linked list (in chronological order) of a bunch of things I (should) read..</p>
