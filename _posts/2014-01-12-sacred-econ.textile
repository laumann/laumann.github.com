title: Sacred Economics

A late addition to my reading list is _Sacred Economics_ by Charles Eisenstein. The book is about an alternative to the money economy, which he calls gift economy. From first glance the topic sounds interesting, but I have not dug into it yet. The book can be downloaded from "here":http://sacred-economics.com. An @epub@ version is available, which I'm gonna try to read.
