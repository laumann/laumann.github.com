It's about time I gathered some of the resources I have on @make@ (specifically GNU @make@)

* "GNU `make`":http://www.gnu.org/s/hello/manual/make/
* "Red Antigua - C Tutorials - Makefile examples":http://www.redantigua.com/c-make-index.html

Well, I thought I had more, but the GNU manual is pretty good I find.
