---

Following "this link":http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/3540/what-are-the-recent-tcs-books-whose-drafts-are-available-online is a rather good resource on TCS(Theoretical Computer Science) book drafts freely available online. I've been looking at a few today, and the following look really interesting:

* "*Algorithms*":http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms.html by S. Dasgupta, C.H. Papadimitriou, and U.V. Vazirani

* "*Tree Automata Techniques and Applications*":http://tata.gforge.inria.fr/ by Hubert Comon, Max Dauchet, Remi Gilleron, Florent Jacquemard, Denis Lugiez, Christof LÃ¶ding, Sophie Tison and Marc Tommasi
* "*Logical Foundations of Proof Complexity*":http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/book/ by Stephen Cook and Phuong Nguyen
* "*Data Streams Algorithms and Applications*":http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~muthu/stream-1-1.ps by S. Muthukrishnan (ps)
