title: Distractionless reading
---

Even though this serves as a mish-mash of differently connected resources, I've currently been reading _The Shallows_[1] and followingly I've decided to render links more or less invisible.

In the top corner of the page I've introduced a little text in the right called "SHOW LINKS" which, when clicked, shows all the links on the page. The default is to hide all the links. By hiding I mean that they don't stand out in any way from the ordinary text--hovering above the links will not change the cursor, the link text is undecorated and has the same colour as the rest of the text.

The links however are not deactivated--they are still clickable, so watch out.
