title: Building the Linux Kernel
---

Although I have this book lying around on the computer, it's nice to have the resource here:

* "Linux Kernel in a Nutshell":http://www.kroah.com/lkn/ by _Greg Kroah-Hartmann_
* "Learning Linux Kernel":http://www.learninglinuxkernel.com/ also seems like a decent place (although it's probably outdated)
