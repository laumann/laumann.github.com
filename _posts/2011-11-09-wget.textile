It seems unnecessarily difficult to download the contents of a subdirectory on a website via HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol). I don't want to go through the browser hell of right click, save as, etc. when there are tools such as @wget@.

The closest I got was:

bc(terminal). $ wget -r -l1 -np -nd --reject "index.html*",robots.txt  http://www.cs.princeton.edu/\~appel/modern/ml/chap2/

which still downloaded the @robots.txt@ file.

I had to change it to:

bc(terminal). $ wget -e robots=off -r -l1 -np -nd -R "index.html*",robots.txt http://www.cs.princeton.edu/\~appel/modern/ml/chap2/

to make @wget@ ignore the @robots.txt@ file.
