As well as being named after one of my favourite science fiction books, "Foundation":http://foundation.zurb.com is the best candidate for web framework I have found to date.

I bought _Foundation_ by Isaac Asimov online for about $3 -- the cost of shipping from the US to Denmark was more than twice the price of the book. But I quite liked this edition, and I really liked reading it. It still sits in the collection at home, I think I've read it twice now.
