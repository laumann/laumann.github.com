title: Octal permissions values

As it says, it _is_ really simple:

* "chmod octal cheat sheet":http://kernelhack.com/?p=22

table{border:1px solid black; width:200px; margin: 0 auto 0 auto}.
| &nbsp; |=. user |=. group |=. all |
|=. 7 |=. @rwx@ |=. @rwx@ |=. @rwx@ |
|=. 6 |=. @rw-@ |=. @rw-@ |=. @rw-@ |
|=. 5 |=. @r-x@ |=. @r-x@ |=. @r-x@ |
|=. 4 |=. @r--@ |=. @r--@ |=. @r--@ |
|=. 3 |=. @-wx@ |=. @-wx@ |=. @-wx@ |
|=. 2 |=. @-w-@ |=. @-w-@ |=. @-w-@ |
|=. 1 |=. @--x@ |=. @--x@ |=. @--x@ |
|=. 0 |=. @---@ |=. @---@ |=. @---@ |


One example is the permission @755@ that translates to @rwxr-xr-x@ giving the owner @rwx@, and anyone else can only read and execute it. This is useful for scripts, that you want outsiders to be able to read and execute, but not modify.
