Today was pushups Friday! And of course skipping. My technique has definitely improved a little, I'm making less mistakes and can skip faster. It's tougher, but once I'm warmed up, it's a good deal of fun.

I also went shopping today--nothing remarkable about that, except I went in my VFFs. It's been a long time since I went out "barefoot", and I'd almost forgotten how tough it can be. But it does feel a lot better. It's strange going out, being scared that your feet will get cold, where in reality I get the feeling that your feet have much the same ability as your face in being able to endure harsher weather than, say, our bellies. Even though I stepped in a puddle of cold water the friction soon gave me heat again. I believe the freedom to work as they should gives your feet all the energy they need.
