I have been reading about "Richard Stallman":http://stallman.org/ today and the work of the "Free Software Foundation":http://www.fsf.org/:

* "A follow-up on a post about Steve Jobs":http://stallman.org/archives/2011-jul-oct.html?ohai#27_October_2011_%28Steve_Jobs%29
* "Defective by design":http://defectivebydesign.com
* "Extinguishing the fire of learning":http://www.defectivebydesign.org/kindle-fire

On the front page of Stallman's website there's a banner indicating he's not *f'd*. Go and look at the "stallman.org":stallman.org front page and you'll see it -- I do my best never to mention the name of this particular "social" network, in the hopes that neglicience will put it to rest. But linked to this banner was a somewhat interesting article:

* "Not your friend":http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/may/14/facebook-not-your-friend; I have to admit I don't care for his use of Google as the innocent opponent.
* "A Bewildering Tangle of Options":http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/12/business/facebook-privacy.html?ref=personaltech
* "Google's Transparency Report":http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/oct/25/google-transparency-report-released
* "Occupy London Part-Time Protest":http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/oct/25/occupy-london-part-time-protest
