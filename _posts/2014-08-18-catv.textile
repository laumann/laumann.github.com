title: Considered Harmful
---

I love "cat-v.org":http://cat-v.org. Especially the "section on Java":http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/java, the language in which I was brought up and currently work in. And love to hate.

	</div>
</div>
</notextile>

This why I turn to languages such as "Go":http://golang.org and "Rust":http://rust-lang.org.
