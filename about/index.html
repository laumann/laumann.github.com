	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am a full-time Master's student at DIKU (Computer Science at Copenhagen University) , with a Bs.C. in Computer Science from Århus University.</p>
	<p>I started programming at the age of 21 upon entering the University in Århus, which is comparatively late when looking at the average initiation age for students of Computer Science</p>

	<p><span class="inline-title">Programming Languages</span> My interests in Computer Science are rather broad, but one of my
	chief interests is <em>programming languages</em>. The study and
	implementation of programming languages is extremely interesting. I have
	used and studied the following programming languages:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://scheme.org/">Scheme</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://latex-project.org/"><span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span></a></li>
		<li><a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://python.org/">Python</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://cprogramming.org/">C</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/java">Java</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://scheme.org/">Scheme</a></li>
		<li>JavaScript</li>
	</ul>

	<p><span class="inline-title">Free and Open Source Software</span> I am
	a strong supporter of the Free Software movement and <a
	href="http://fsf.org">FSF</a>, and believe the Open Source way of
	developing software is the path of the future.</p>

	<p>For software I use vim, Zsh, <a href="http://git-scm.org">git</a> and
	I have been working on a todo list keeper. I follow the development of
	some software projects, notably <a href="http://kernel.org">Linux</a>,
	git and <a href="http://github.com/jonas/tig">tig</a>. I have also made
	a small contribution to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, the
	static site generator (in Ruby).</p>

	<p>Another interest is <em>social media</em>. Not as user, but as a
	critic. I believe there is so much unnecessary noise out there that
	everybody would benefit more from not being around it so much. There is
	also a question of people not knowing they are a resource for the media
	they are using, since most believe the media to be a resource for them
	to use. One of my favorite discussions topics is how much certain social
	media sites have managed to shift the terms of privacy (but I'll leave
	this topic for another time).</p>
