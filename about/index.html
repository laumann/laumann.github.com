	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I hold a Master's degree from DIKU (Computer Science at
	Copenhagen University), with a Bs.C. in Computer Science from
	Århus University.</p>

	<p>I started programming relatively late at the age of 21 when
	I started my computer science degree at the University
	in Århus.</p>

	<p><span class="inline-title">Programming</span> I love
	programming. My interests in Computer Science are rather
	broad, but one of my chief interests is <em>programming
	languages</em>. The study and implementation of programming
	languages is extremely interesting. I have experience working
	with and studying the following list of languages
	<ul class="inlist">
		<li><a href="http://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>,</li>
		<li><a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>,</li>
		<li><a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a>,</li>
		<li><a href="http://scheme.org/">Scheme</a>,</li>
		<li><a href="http://latex-project.org/"><span
					class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span></a>,</li>
		<li><a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>,</li>
		<li><a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>,</li>
		<li><a href="http://cprogramming.org/">C</a>,</li>
		<li><a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/java">Java</a>,</li>
		<li><a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a>,</li>
		<li><a href="http://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>,</li>
		<li><a href="http://scheme.org/">Scheme</a> and </li>
		<li>JavaScript</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>Up until recently, I used Go all the time, because it is just
	awesome. As an exercise I implemented a <a
	href="http://rubular.com/">Rubular</a>-like regular expression editor
	and tester <a href="http://greg-go.appspot.com">Greg</a>. Currently I'm learning
	Rust, which so far I think is
	pretty decent. It is still rough around the edges, but the declared
	goals of Rust are a tall order, so some roughness is to be expected.</p>

	<p><span class="inline-title">Free and Open Source Software</span> I am
	a strong supporter of the Free Software movement and <a
	href="http://fsf.org">FSF</a>, and believe the Open Source way of
	developing software is the path of the future.</p>

	<p>For software I use Emacs, vim,
	Zsh, <a href="http://git-scm.org">git</a>. I follow the
	development of some software projects,
	notably <a href="http://kernel.org">Linux</a>, git
	and <a href="http://github.com/jonas/tig">tig</a>.</p>

	<p><span class="inline-title">Social media</span> I
	don't. "Social media" should be considered bad, even as a
	term. I think there is so much unnecessary noise out there that
	everybody would benefit more from not being around it so much. There is
	also a question of people not knowing they are a resource for the media
	they are using, since most believe the media to be a resource for them
	to use. One of my favorite discussions topics is how much certain social
	media sites have managed to shift the terms of privacy (but I'll leave
	this topic for another time).</p>

	<p>That being said, I do have an online presence on some sites:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>laumann.thomas</code> <code>at</code> <code>gmail.com</code></li>
		<li><a href="http://github.com/laumann">github.com/laumann</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://couchsurfing.org">couchsurfing.org/laumann</a></li>
	</ul>
